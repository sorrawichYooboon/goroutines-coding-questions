package main

// Write a Go program that intentionally creates a deadlock scenario using Go routines and channels.
// Then, modify the program to detect and handle the deadlock.
// The detection mechanism should log a message when a deadlock is detected and gracefully terminate the program.

// Hint: Use a combination of select statements and timeouts to detect potential deadlocks.
