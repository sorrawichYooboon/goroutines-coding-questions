package main

// Write a Go program that simulates a distributed workload using a worker pool pattern.
// Create a fixed number of worker Go routines that process tasks from a shared task queue.
// The main function should generate a large number of tasks and distribute them among the worker Go routines.
// Ensure that the program can handle tasks being added dynamically while the workers are processing.

// Hint: Use buffered channels to implement the task queue and sync.WaitGroup to manage the completion of tasks.
