package main

// Write a Go program that reads multiple files concurrently using Go routines.
// Each Go routine should count the number of words in a file and send the result back to the main function.
// The main function should then sum up the word counts from all files and print the total.

// Hint: Use channels to send the word count results back to the main function.
