// Write a Go program that multiplies two matrices in parallel using Go routines.
// Each goroutine should be responsible for calculating the value of one element in the resulting matrix.
// Ensure the main function waits for all goroutines to complete before printing the final matrix.

// Hint: Use channels to collect the results and sync.WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines.
