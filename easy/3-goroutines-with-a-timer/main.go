package main

// Write a Go program where a goroutine waits for a certain duration (e.g., 2 seconds) before printing "Hello, Goroutine!". Meanwhile,
// the main function should continue executing other code and then wait for the goroutine to finish.

// Hint: Use the time.Sleep function for the timer and sync.WaitGroup to wait for the goroutine.
